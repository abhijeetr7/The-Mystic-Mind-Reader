# The-Mystic-Mind-Reader

This application provides a "Mind Reader" joke experience.

Here's how it works:

Welcome Screen: You'll see a mystical-themed introduction.

Start: Click "Start" to begin the trick.

Instructions: The app will guide you through a series of mathematical steps (e.g., "Add 5," "Multiply by 2"). Follow these steps mentally with a number you've chosen.

Suspense: After the last math step, there's a moment of suspense before the "reveal."

Reveal: The app will then "magically" reveal the number you ended up with â€“ which, thanks to the mathematical trick, will always be '3'!

Play Again: You can restart the trick as many times as you like.

I've used Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and mystical design, and Tone.js for subtle sound effects to enhance the experience.
